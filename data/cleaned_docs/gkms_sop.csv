" Bulletin in the year 1945. With the advent of technology, space based observations; extension of weather observational network, skill of weather forecasting has improved significantly. The customized weather information in the form of agromet advisory also followed an era of evolution. In the year 2008, District level agrometeorological advisory service (AAS) was initiated by IMD, Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) in collaboration with ICAR and State Agriculture Universities through network of "
"Agrometeorological Field Units (AMFUs). The main emphasis of the existing AAS system, now known as Gramin Krishi Mausam Seva (GKMS), is to collect and organize climate/weather, soil and crop information, and to amalgamate them with weather forecast to assist farmers in taking management decisions. In view of importance of the AAS to farming community, the present system of district level agromet advisory is underway to extend up to sub-district/ block level with dissemination up to village level"
" to meet the end users requirements with establishment of District Agro- Meteorological Units (DAMUs) in each rural district of India. With extension of GKMS network it is felt that there is a requirement of a well laid out system/methodology for preparation of Agromet Advisory Bulletin (AAB) at IMD, AMFUS and DAMUs and its dissemination to users. Considering such requirements, the Agromet team of IMD has brought out a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), to streamline the operational processes c"
"arried out at each step of advisory preparation and its dissemination. I express my deep appreciation to all the experts and the officials involved in preparing this useful document. Dr M. Rajeevan Secretary, Ministry of Earth Sciences ii Preface Agrometeorological Advisory Service (AAS) of India Meteorological Department (IMD), Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) under Gramin Krishi Mausam Sewa (GKMS) scheme contribute to collect and organize climate/weather, soil and crop information and to amal"
gamate them with weather forecast to assist farmers in taking management decisions. Weather forecast based agromet advisory provided to the farmers at district level through a network of existing 130 Agro-Met Field Units (AMFUs) located in each Agro Climatic Zone (ACZ). These agromet advisories are prepared and disseminated by AMFUs twice a week (Tuesday and Friday) covering 690 districts under (GKMS) scheme. Currently 4.37 Crore farmers are receiving SMS advisory on their mobile phones through 
"mKisan portal. Keeping the need for Agromet Advisory Services (AAS) to be more crop and location-specific to address wide variations in weather within the, IMD is in the process of implementing block level AAS by establishing 530 District Agromet Units (DAMUs) in the premises of Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVK) in collaboration with Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). Implementation of block level AAS would be beneficial to more number of farmers due to high resolution forecast with appro"
"priate agromet advisories for the farmers of specific blocks. In the present scenario, when network under GKMS scheme is being extended at district level with target to reach every farming household, it is very important for the officials involved in bulletin preparation to understand the process of preparing an efficient and effective user specific bulletin. So there was a need to bring Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for advisory preparation in order to have uniform standard advisory throug"
"hout the country. This SOP is outcome of dedicated effort of agromet team of IMD. I hope that document would prove a useful reference material for advisory preparation, feedback and dissemination.

" Tmax/Tmin Maximum/Minimum Temperature v India Meteorological Department Gramin Krishi Mausam Sewa (GKMS) Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Preparation of Agromet Advisory Service (AAS) bulletins 1. Introduction Weather is the major factor in crop growth and production. While all other physical factors, inputs and agronomic practices can be manipulated, vagaries of weather cannot be controlled. However, adverse effects on crops can often be mitigated. Thus risk in agricultural operations can be"
" minimized by the provision of weather information properly interpreted for their agricultural significance, containing advisories for farm operation and disseminated well in advance of the impending weather. This is by far the most crucial of all services that can be rendered to the farming community efficiently. In view of above, Agrometeorological Advisory Service (AAS) are being rendered by India Meteorological Department (IMD), Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) under Gramin Krishi Mausam Se"
"wa (GKMS) scheme as a step towards contribution to weather information- based crop/livestock management strategies and operations dedicated to enhancing crop production and food security. AAS provide a very special kind of inputs to the farmer as advisories that can make a tremendous difference to the agriculture production by taking the advantage of benevolent weather and minimize the adverse impact of malevolent weather. Under AAS, needs of farming community are defined through ascertaining in"
"formation requirement of diverse groups of end-users. It emerged that prime need of the farmer is location specific weather forecast in quantitative terms. Hence, the same was developed and made operational in June, 2008. Accordingly, mechanism was developed to integrate weather forecast and climatic information along with agrometeorological information to prepare district level agro- advisories with the help of 130 Agromet Field Units (AMFUs), located at State Agricultural Universities, Indian "
"Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) institutes and Indian Institute of Technology across the country. A system has also been developed to communicate and disseminate the agromet advisories to strengthen the information outreach. Keeping the need for Agromet Advisory Services (AAS) to be more crop and location-specific to address wide variations in weather within the district into consideration, IMD is in the process of implementing block level AAS by establishing 530 District Agromet Units ("
"DAMUs) phase wise in the premise of Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVK) in collaboration with Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). Implementation of block level AAS will be beneficial to more no. of farmers due to high resolution forecast with appropriate agromet advisories for the farmers of specific blocks. Present and Proposed network of GKMS attached in Annexure 1 Under GKMS scheme, IMD is generating and issuing quantitative District / Block level weather forecast up to 5 days exclusively"
" for agriculture. The products comprise of quantitative forecasts for major weather parameters viz., rainfall, maximum and minimum temperatures, wind speed and direction, relative humidity and cloudiness. These products are used by the AMFUs / DAMUs for the preparation of district / Block level agromet advisories 1 twice a week, i.e. on every Tuesday and Friday and dissemination to the farming community to help them in taking appropriate decisions for day-to-day farm operations. 1.1 Objective of"
" Scheme  To continuously improve the existing District level Agromet Advisory Services (AAS) and extend them further to sub district/ block level.  To establish District Agromet Units (DAMUs), complimentarily with already operating 130 AMFUs/DAMUs, in collaboration with Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) at Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs).  To expand the existing channels of communication of weather based Agromet Advisories to the farmers so as to expand the outreach to cover all far"
mer households.  Promote Research & Excellence in Agro-meteorology in support of targeted improvement to the operational services. 1.2 Current Status Currently GKMS scheme is being carried out through 130 AMFUs in each Agro-climatic Zone who prepares District level AAB for all the districts under their jurisdiction and also Block level advisories for all the blocks of their respective district location. Phase wise DAMU establishment in the premises of KVK under GKMS is currently completed at 18
9 locations and it is targeted to achieve the objective of establishing DAMU by 2021-2022. All the established DAMUs have started to prepare block level AAB for all the blocks of their respective districts. 690 district level AAB in operational mode and ~ 2200 blocks on pilot basis are prepared on every Tuesday and Friday. 1.3 Scope of SOP This document defines the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to be followed for Preparation of Agromet Advisory Service (AAS) bulletins in order to achieve th
